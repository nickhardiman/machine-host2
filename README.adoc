The physical machine host2 will be described in mind-numbing detail at https://hardiman.consulting/, assuming I ever have free time ever again.

```
my workstation --> host2 <-- GitHub 
```

Run the shell script to kick off the whole process.

* shell script to run on host2: machine-host2-configure.sh
* Ansible playbook for host2: machine-host2-configure.yml 
* shell script to run on my workstation: machine-workstation-configure.sh
